# Git and RStudio

See Chapter 14 of this excellent ebook: _Happy Git and GitHub for the useR_ by Jennifer Bryan <https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html>

## Add a remote


With a shell, go to the folder which will be associated with a Git repository:

```{markdown}
git remote add origin https://github.com/3wen/repo-name.git
git pull origin main
git remote -v
```

If the Pull/Push buttons are not available on RStudio:
```{markdown}
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
```


## New commit

In RStudio:

- In the Git tab, click on "Commit"
- A new window opens. Tick the box of each file to commit and add a commit message
- Click on the "Commit button". This closes the window.
- If you want to push the changes to the Git repository, in the Git tab, click on the "Push" button.


Or, in a shell, to commit all changes:

```{markdown}
git add --all
git commit -m "Reason of the commit"
git push -u origin main
```

## Problem with main branch


To list the local branches:
```{markdown}
git branch
```

To delete a local branch:

```{markdown}
git branch --delete <branchname>
```

Then :
```{markdown}
git push -u origin main
```
